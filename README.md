# Tailwind CSS Gradient Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked issue when using Tailwind CSS gradients: conflicts with other classes that disrupt gradient application.

## The Problem

Tailwind's gradient utilities are powerful, but they can be sensitive to conflicting styles.  Improperly nested classes, conflicting sizing, positioning, or the use of `!important` flags can prevent the gradient from rendering correctly or produce unexpected visual results.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of such a conflict.  Observe how the gradient is either partially obscured or completely missing depending on the surrounding classes.

## The Solution

The solution is careful class management. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to correct the conflict by addressing the source of the conflict, either refactoring problematic classes, ensuring correct nesting, or carefully managing specificity.

Make sure that your classes are logically structured, avoid unnecessary `!important` declarations, and inspect your browser's developer tools to pinpoint the conflicting CSS rules.  Understanding CSS specificity is vital for debugging these types of issues.
