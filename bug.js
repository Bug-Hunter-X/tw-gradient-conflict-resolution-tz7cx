```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  However, if the `...` contains conflicting or improperly nested classes that interfere with the gradient's application, it can lead to unexpected visual results or the gradient not appearing at all.  For example, an improperly placed `!important` flag or conflicting sizing or positioning classes could cause issues.
